## ðŸ“š Project Analysis  
Our primary goal in this project is to Analyze the change in weather patterns over the period from 1979 to 2022 and see if there are any changes in weather patterns over East Lansing. The big picture is it can be co-related with the population change of the area to see the effects of the human population on nature. This project is useful for Meteorologists as it can see if any weather patterns have been formed over the last 40 years and if there are any cycles. It can also be used to understand how human life has an impact on the surrounding climate and predict if the impact might have more adverse results in the future.  

## Problem Statement  
The webapp will try to visualize the change in temperature and weather data and try to convey how this change in climate affects their lives and attempt to educate why various health and geological issues occur in East Lansing.
